# knowleJ, a propositional logic knowledge graph library
<diagram image here>
knowleJ is a Java library for managing knowledge graphs using Neo4J. It is designed to store propositional inference and deduction chains, facilitating the representation, memory, and proof of system processes. The library provides robust methods for inputting, proving, storing, and reusing propositional logic representations.

## Features
```
	•	Propositional Inference and Deduction: Supports storing and manipulating chains of propositional inferences and equivalencies.
	•	Neo4J Integration: Utilizes Neo4J as the backend for efficient storage and querying of knowledge graphs.
	•	Proof Checking: Provides tools for verifying the validity of inference chains and logical equivalencies.
	•	Flexible API: Offers methods for inputting and managing propositional logic representations.
```

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
```
	•	Java 11 or later
